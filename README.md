# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

The purpose of this project was to create a treasure hunt game where a NPC was trying to find treasure. The game is a maze puzzle game. The files GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py were given to me in order to complete the code for the game. The code that i completed was located in the #TODO: Complete the Q-Training Algorithm Code Block in the Gambrell_Shaniqua_ProjectTwo.ipynb file. Computer scientists use software and hardware to solve issues in a variety of corporate, industry, scientific, and social contexts. The best way to approach a problem as a computer scientist is by collecting as much information as possible. Data is the best tool when it comes to science and computers. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization should always be privacy and keeping their data and information from the outside world.
